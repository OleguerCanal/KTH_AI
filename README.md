# KTH AI

KTH Artificial Intelligence course practices:

The two projects done consists of:
  * Development of probability algorithms (Forward, Backward, Viterbi, Baum-Welch) and their implementation into the "Duck Hunt" game to automatize it achieving a great performance.
  
  * Implementation of mini-max and alpha-beta pruning algorithms to develop a system which provides a great winning rate in both tic-tac-toe (2D and 3D) and checkers.
