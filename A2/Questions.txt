1. Describe the possible states, initial state, transition function.



Describe the terminal states of both checkers and tic-tac-toe.
Checkers: A player has 0 checkers left
TTT: A player aligns 3 pieces, or there is no space left

Why is ν(A,s)=#{white checkers}−#{red checkers} a valid heuristic function for checkers (knowing that A plays white and B plays red)?
Because A wants to maximize the number of white checkers and minimize the number of red ones.
